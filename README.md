# Tailwind-cssDemo
Created with CodeSandbox
This project was built using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. The goal was to create a responsive and visually clean user interface while reinforcing core frontend development concepts. Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach significantly streamlined the styling process, allowing for rapid prototyping and consistent design patterns without writing custom CSS from scratch.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in structuring semantic HTML, implementing responsive layouts, and efficiently using utility classes to manage spacing, typography, and component styling. It served as a solid foundation for deepening my understanding of modern frontend development workflows.
