Assignment Title: Build Your Personal Portfolio Website
📄 Objective:
To create a personal portfolio website using only HTML and Tailwind CSS. This website will act as a professional online identity showcasing your skills, projects, resume, and contact information.

🗒️ Requirements:
Your portfolio site should include at least 4 fully responsive sections/pages and follow good UI/UX practices. Below are the minimum sections and their content:

🏠 1. Home Section
Brief introduction of yourself (Name, title e.g. Web Developer/Designer)

A professional photo or avatar (can use placeholder image)

A small catchy tagline or quote

A "Download Resume" button

Navigation bar with links to each section (use smooth scroll or anchor tags)

💡 Bonus: Add a dynamic typing effect using Tailwind plugins (optional).

🙋‍♂️ 2. About Me Section
A paragraph or two about you (background, interests, goals)

A list of key skills (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

A timeline or list of education and/or experience

Use Tailwind's flex, grid, and card components for layout

💡 Tip: Use Tailwind utility classes like bg-gray-100, rounded-lg, p-4, etc., to style content blocks.

💼 3. Projects Section
Showcase at least 3 projects (real or dummy)

Each project should include:

Project Title

Screenshot (placeholder image is fine)

Description (what it does, tools used)

Link to GitHub repo (optional)

Use Tailwind's grid or flex layout for organizing the project cards

💡 Bonus: Hover effect using Tailwind transitions (e.g., hover:scale-105, hover:shadow-lg)

📞 4. Contact Section
A simple contact form with:

Name

Email

Message

Submit button

Use Tailwind's form classes to style inputs

No backend functionality required, only frontend

💡 Optional: Add social media icons using Tailwind-compatible icon libraries like Heroicons or FontAwesome.

🌐 Additional Guidelines:
Your website must be fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Use only HTML and Tailwind CSS (no Bootstrap or custom CSS).

Folder structure should be organized (/images, /pages, etc.).

Use semantic HTML tags (<section>, <nav>, <header>, <footer>)

Include comments in HTML where necessary to explain sections.

✅ Deliverables:

GitHub link (optional but encouraged)

Screenshot of final UI on desktop and mobile

A short paragraph (README) explaining your experience building it
